				<p class="quote">“A key to understanding what possessions mean is recognizing that, knowing or unknowingly, intentionally or unintentionally, we regard our possessions as part of ourselves.”</p>

				<p class="text-label t-dark-blue">overview</p>
			</div>
			<div class="l-text">
				<p class="long-text">In America, a country focused on mass-production and consumerism, people tend to accumulate objects without understanding why they choose to keep those objects in their lives. Writers like sociologist Russell Belk and expert-organizer Marie Kondo are challenging this notion, suggesting that objects are reflections of ourselves and even impact our well-being. Artists are doing the same, photographing, drawing, sculpting, and creating performances about their objects and others’.</p><br>
				<p class="long-text">Open House was born out of a process of parsing through my possessions and keeping only what I find meaningful. The website compiles 381 physical objects located in my bedroom into a purely digital space, using only text and infographics as mediums for discovery. Objects fit into the categories of whether they are on display or stored, and whether they are beautiful, practical, or both. In more detail, the object descriptions explore memories and how, when, and where the objects were acquired. In confronting everything I own, viewers of Open House are left to question interactions with their own possessions and what meanings they have developed for themselves.</p>

				<p class="long-text">In 2012, Swedish photographer Sannah Kvist asked other students born in the 80s, herself included, to build a sculpture using everything they owned and pose with them in a series dubbed “All I Own.” The photographs show the different personalities and interests of the subjects--some with stacks of books, others with clothes--and how little they own.</p>

				<p class="long-text">Peter Menzel also photographed families with everything they owned--across the world. Menzel brought together 16 photojournalists to publish Material World: A Global Family Portrait in 1995, capturing life in 30 nations. Comparing Menzels’ photographs is ultimately a comparison of culture, values, and economy.</p>

				<p class="long-text">Unlike Kvist and Menzel, Brooklyn artist Mary Mattingly is looking at her own objects. In the site own-it.us, Mattingly categorizes, photographs, and 3D scans each object she owns and writes about the material history of each, feeling consumers have responsibility over the effect their possessions have on the world. On the about page she states, “Researching each item’s history is a way to begin an extended funeral prayer, illuminating rituals and tragedies embedded in objects in a precarious world. From the over-extraction of the earth, to the working conditions of the makers and distributors, to the chemicals that enter the air and water affecting everyone, each object is embedded with trauma.”</p>

				<p class="long-text">Mattingly’s objects then become performative actions, tieing and making bundles out of them, and in some cases, rolling them across bridges. The density of the bundles makes it difficult to move them, but doing so celebrates and critiques their journeys, from source material to final product, into Mattingly’s life.</p>

				<p class="long-text">Designer/illustrator Emily Okada and photographer Corey Vaughn, have also compiled their possessions into a website, Every Little Everything. For every month in 2015, they documented objects, experimenting with their chosen mediums, and wrote about their importance. Their goal was to get rid of everything undocumented by January 1st, 2016, but it seems they only made it through September and it is unclear what the final result was.</p>

				<p class="long-text">My own artistic interest in ownership began in 2014, when over the course of two weekends and 15 hours total, I photographed 366 individual objects on a kraft paper background. I didn’t find the time to finish photographing all of the smaller items, but the concept of documenting everything I owned stayed on my mind.<br><br>When I decided to tackle it again, I discovered that what I truly wanted to represent was the looser associations that each object brings. All of these artists working within the realm of ownership (including myself in 2014) had one thing in common: using imagery to represent objects. To change that this time around, I chose to only use text, focusing on memories, people, and places, rather than on the physical attributes of each object.</p>

			<div class="l-text">
				<p class="long-text">In January 2017, I started going through my possessions one by one, getting rid of items that were no longer practical or beautiful--the two factors I found to be most important. Some decisions were easy--getting rid of things I would never use again like old papers and drawing supplies--some were much harder. I gave up Warped Passages, my fingerless gloves, a North Face beanie, a velvet tote bag, a Lizzie McGuire Movie CD, felted wool I made, oil painting supplies, and hundreds of other objects.<br><br>I refrained from throwing out objects as much as possible, trying to be conscious of the environmental effects. If an object couldn’t be recycled, and was in good enough condition, it changed ownership. I sold a few things I know I had paid a lot for, like my oil paints, but most of it I gave away for free. On sunny days, I set out boxes of free books and yarn and art supplies, and posted a curb alert to MICA’s free and for sale page. Each time, the objects were gone within just a couple of hours. I brought other objects, like clothes and home decor, to MICA’s swap shop, off on a slower move to new ownership.</p>
