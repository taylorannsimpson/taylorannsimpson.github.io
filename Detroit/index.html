		<p class="bold-text">Detroit is a changing city. In 2010 the Census Bureau’s population count was 713,777, down almost 25% from the 2000 count coming in at 951,307. In the past few years there has been word of Detroit becoming “the Next Berlin,” and on the Pure Michigan site, it reads “Detroit: America’s Great Comeback City,” with a nighttime view of the downtown area. But what does that mean? Mostly we hear about how millennials are fleeing to Detroit, where the housing is cheap—contributing to gentrification—and how the downtown area is seeing a resurgence. And the rest of the city? Detroit is 149.2 square miles, with the downtown area only taking up 1.39 square miles of that. The new QLine, set to launch in May 2017, will only service a little more than 3 miles in the downtown, midtown, and new center areas. The good news: near the end of 2016, 65,000 new streetlights were added, sprawling the city and making it okay for people—like restaurant goers and school kids—to go out in the dark.</p><br>
		<p class="reg-text">Using public data updated weekly, this site aims to focus on the whole of Detroit’s property, highlighting concrete and individual sources of change. Rather than focusing on large, years-long projects, it focuses on site-specific changes created by the residents and government. Projects like demolitions mean new builds or room for public spaces like gardens, and auction sales show that people are invested in rebuilding what’s there. Submitted issues allow residents to alert the government of what needs to be fixed, and permits show what residents are fixing themselves. Here’s to building Detroit, one block at a time.</p><br>
