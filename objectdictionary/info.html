				<p class="meaning">Object Dictionary compiles the objects displayed in my bedroom into three categories: practical, beautiful, and those that are both. Their definitions explore personal meaning through memories, people, and places, rather than what outsiders would view at first glance–physical descriptions or means of use.</p>
				<p class="object">degree project</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Over time, objects become ours without full consent. They are handed down, found, placed in our spaces, purchased, and without full consideration of why, we keep them. Sometimes we do choose to keep an object, but for the wrong reasons–guilt and sentimentality are common ones. We are left with a mass. There are a few objects we need, a few that we cherish, and the rest are inconsequential. In our American consumer-focused culture, we rarely digest the importance of what we choose to surround ourselves with. Open House aims to analyze this truth through documenting and writing about everything I own. And in the process, ridding of unnecessary items as I go along. The writing will be personal, exploring memories, origin, connections to others, and tackling why I have chosen to display, hide, or rid of these objects. Viewers of Open House will be left to analyze their own sense of ownership, inevitably comparing the meaning of my objects to theirs.</p>
